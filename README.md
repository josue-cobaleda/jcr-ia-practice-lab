# jcr-ia-practice-lab
A personal lab for practicing machine learning and AI modeling with notebooks. Includes coursework and exploratory studies from my master's program and more. 

# 💼 Business‑Oriented Data & AI Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases **hands‑on solutions to real‑world business problems** using data science, machine‑learning and analytics.  
It is designed as a living portfolio that demonstrates how I:

* Translate raw data into **actionable insights**
* Select and tune the **right algorithm for the business question**
* Communicate results clearly to stakeholders

## 🔑 Key Business Competencies

* **Predictive Analytics** – lift conversion, reduce churn, optimize pricing  
* **Risk & Classification** – probability‑driven decisions (credit, fraud, attrition)  
* **Segmentation & Personalization** – KNN‐based customer grouping, recommender groundwork  
* **Operational Efficiency** – Random Forest/XGBoost feature importance for process redesign  
* **Explainability** – model interpretability sections for non‑technical leaders
